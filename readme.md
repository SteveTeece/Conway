# Conway
## Conway's Game of Life in CSharp

Conway is my attempt at an object-oriented version of Conway's Game of Life.

I'm sure using a simple two-dimensional bool array, rather than cell objects, would have been more efficient and easier to implement, but where's the fun in that?

## Instructions

Click on cells to set them alive and then hit 'Play' to start the generations.
